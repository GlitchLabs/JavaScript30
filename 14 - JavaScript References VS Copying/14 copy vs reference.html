    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = "Dom Kennedy";

    // however what happens when we update that array?


    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    const team2= players.slice();//returns the entire array
    
    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3= [].concat(players);


    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];


    const team5 = Array.from(players);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    // const captain = person;
    // captain.number = 99;

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const captain2 = Object.assign({},person,{number:99})
    console.log(captain2);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    captain3 = {...person};

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
